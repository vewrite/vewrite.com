## Launching Vewrite to beta testers

March was a particularly exciting month as we launched the first version of Vewrite to the public. You can now [hop on over to the app](https://app.vewrite.com/) and join the beta test. In this product report I'm going to talk briefly about some of the new features that were added in the last month. 

Following that, I'm going to talk about some feedback that we've gotten from users and how we are going to address those issue and missing features that people have identified as critical to their workflows.

### A few words on Vewrite's v1.0.0 release

Since we started working on Vewrite in August, we've had a vision of allowing teams of writers to be able to build content better together. Every solution on the market today requires that you use a constellation of tools to:

- organize your team
- track your work
- do your writing
- review and approve deliverables

Anyone who has done written work together with others (be they clients, stakeholders, or team members) will know how tedious and painful this process can be. I've done it. It's not great. I want something better.

Typically, this means that teams manually make copies of documents, share them either via google drive, sharepoint, or email, and manually review everything. Work is tracked in a spreadsheet or some todo list like Notion, Trello, or JIRA. The process is incredibly error prone, and managing it is often a nightmare. Stuff is constantly falling through the cracks.

To be able to achieve the next big set of features for Vewrite, we need to dial in the basics of how we can organize projects, write deliverabls with others, get them reviewed and approved, and send them off to where they need to be sent off.

It hasn't been a trivial task to find what we felt were the right set of features to make this process better, and we think that we have at least some solid foundation now that we can share with the world.

So, with that said, we're proud to announce that v1.0.0 is ready for you to poke at, prod at, and [let us know what you like](mailto:support@vewrite.com) [or what you don't](https://github.com/vewrite/vewrite/discussions).

## New Features

### Assignments and roles

A core intent for Vewrite has always been as a solution for working with multiple people on one document, but with the idea that there are multiple roles that different functionality is tied to. This means that users must be able to assign roles to work, so that the workflow will have someone to associate that functionality with.

Vewrite now supports Writers and Reviewer on a per-deliverable basis. This means that each workflow state has functionality that is for each role, and how you assign those roles to team members is easily available to the project manager.

### Fullscreen editing

Sometimes you just want to be able to focus on nothing but the writing at hand, and we have made that easy to access with the new fullscreen editing button. It is now easily available in the top actions bar while you are writing your deliverable.

### Documentation

A big part of what we worked on this past month was preparing documentation for Vewrite's public launch. The documentation covers basic concepts that drive the application, and provide a set of simple tutorials which allow users to get up and running quickly.

[You can find the new docs site here](https://docs.vewrite.com/).

## Beta milestone and feedback

Now that we've successfully released v1.0.0, we've started building out the milestone for v1.1.0. You can always follow along the [project's progress on Github](https://github.com/vewrite/vewrite/projects?query=is%3Aopen). It's a public repository and we welcome your input and feedback.

### Changes based on user feedback

The biggest change that we are going to make in the upcoming v1.1.0 release is going to be centered around onboarding and defaults for clients and teams.

For clients, there will be a new "personal" client, which users can use for projects that they are creating for themselves. This will mean that there is one less step for a user to create their first project and its deliverables.

For teams, there is a much bigger change in the works. Originally, the intent was to have users create teams of different writers, reviewers, and stakeholders, and use those to manage who has access to which project. Some of the feedback from beta testers around this added complexity was negative, and we've seen that some users get stuck at this step. 

So, to help streamline both onboarding and day to day use, we're going to be removing teams and replacing them with a simpler "invite to project" functionality that will be baked into the project when you create it.

## A big thank you

I did want to take a moment to thank all of you for your on-going support. It's hard to believe in a project when you don't have direct access to it, and many of you have been with me since the very beginning. Vewrite means a lot to me personally and getting all of this off of the ground has been a long road. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. It means everything to me.

Now, back to work!

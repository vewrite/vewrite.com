## What is Vewrite? 

Simply put, Vewrite is a project management tool for technical writers. With it you will be able to:

- Organize your **projects**
- Create **workflows** that fit your needs
- Manage **deliverables** through workflows
- Track **progress** for stakeholders

Deeply integrated into Vewrite is a talent marketplace that allows your team to quickly add capacity if you need it. 

This, of course, also means that **Vewrite is a place for technical writers to find work and get paid**.

Let's take a few minutes to talk about what all that means.

### A Project Management tool for Technical Writers

As an experienced team of technical writers, project managers, and developer relations specialists, we know how painful it can be to try and manage a large set of content that is in production. The market currently does not provide a toolset that caters to the work that we do. We make do, and that's not good enough!

It's time that we stop using tools that are either a bad fit for our workflows, or are tailored for an entirely different use-case. We aren't developers, working with an agile methodology, and we aren't marketers with a stream of tasks. We have many deliverables, stakeholders who require visibility, and we are juggling multiple projects at once.

Vewrite is a product tailored to making it easier for Technical Writing teams to successfully manage the mountains of work that they plow through every month. We want technical writers, developer relations specialists, and the teams that they work on to have clear workflows, excellent visibility, and access to resources that help them get their work done on-time and on-budget.

### A Talent Marketplace for Technical Writers

For freelance, or other contract-based, technical writers you likely encounter a host of challenges:

- Finding clients to work with
- Managing the work that you do with them
- Getting paid

Vewrite's talent marketplace, which is integrated directly into our project management toolset, allows you to showcase your portfolio of work, be a part of technical writing teams, and get paid all in one easy to use interface. This means that you don't have to bouce around a bunch of different tools to find work, get it done, and get paid for it. It's all streamlined together into one experience.

Of course, for the teams that you work with, this is a huge bonus, because for them you are a quickly added extension to the established process they already know. There is no on-boarding friction. There are no security concerns when adding you (and afterwards removing you) from tools. It all just happens automatically. 

**More writing, less hassle.**


## A Preference for Workflows over Tasks

It's very straightforward to be task-oriented, and that works fine if you're just one person with a pile of work. You self-prioritize and move from task to task. Often people create a daily or weekly to-do list, and plow forward.  That's fine at a certain scale, but when you're trying to manage a small- or medium-sized team, with multiple projects, many deliverables, and lots of in-progress work in different states, it can quickly become a mess. 

Messes aren't very profitable.

Common problems with the pile-o-tasks methodology are:

- **Lack of visibility** - Nobody is really sure what is still left to do
- **Unclear states** - Nobody is really sure whether stuff is done or not
- **Scope creep** - The state of a deliverable is turned into a task because the process wasn't clear from the get-go

Having a well-defined **Workflow** can ensure that there is a clear set of states that your deliverables flow through. This means that when you initialize your project you know both the scope of the deliverables your client will receive and the steps that your team needs to go through to achieve success.

Most modern project management software, including JIRA, Monday, etc. are task-oriented and not workflow-oriented. This is why every project that you run within them feels endless. **The actual scope of work is unclear because the focus is on the deliverable and not on the process to achieve completion.**

Vewrite has a very different mentality when it comes to work and we believe you'll love it.

### Your Software Should Work For You

Most project management tools aren't there to make your job easier as a technical writer. They are there to make your project manager's job easier. They act as a way to collate the status of all the myriad tasks that have been assigned and push that status up the chain. Depending on the tool your team is using, it may include a way to create reports and other analytics that show success or failure over time.

When you click "done", it isn't for you. It's for the manager.

The effect of this, for daily users, is that they feel like they work for the software that they use, instead of the other way around: **because they do**. The project management tool that your team uses should work for both the project manager and the team members who use it.

With this in mind, Vewrite goes out of its way to leverage automated workflows to smooth as much of the ho-hum daily state updates as it can. Our system is smart enough to know where it is in the workflow so that those who need to know do, and those who are doing the work are free to get it done.

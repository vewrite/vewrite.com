## What's new for Vewrite in February 2025

We've had a big month full of hard work and interesting problems to tackle. Vewrite is just weeks away from release to the public and we're excited to talk about its progress, so let's get to it.

### The new Deliverable Manager

As we discussed in the [How to Handle Content States](https://vewrite.com/articles/how-to-handle-content-states) article, we struggled to find a UX solution for the content that fit our beta tester's needs. After months of development, we're proud to announce that we've released the new version of the Deliverable Manager.

This new version has a few critical features that make it stand out from its predecessors:

- Deep integration of the content into the workflow
- Constant access to the content of previous steps
- A non-linear flow for review and approval

Together these create a more robust and usable experience for writers and reviewers.

### Various updates

We've also given a lot of love to smaller parts of Vewrite that project managers and writers will spend a lot of time using.

#### Create Modals

The Create Modals for both Projects and Deliverables have gotten a facelift and are now more usable and accessible.

The Deliverable modal in particular has been updated substantially. It now allows you to view your writing team and assign roles for the deliverable you're working on, enabling assignments for the different states in the workflow based on roles.

#### Filters and search

Filters and search thoughout Vewrite have gotten an upgrade, which will ensure that you and your team can always easily find what you are looking for.

#### Teams update

Teams now have a minimum requirement of two users. By default, when you create a new team, you as the project manager are included as the first member. When teams are ready, they must be marked as such for them to be usable in a project.

## Moving towards release

As we move towards a public release, we encourage you to sign up to become a beta tester. If you're a project manager of a content writing team, we'd love to hear from you. Your feedback is critical to our team as we iterate towards the best possible project management experience for teams of writers and content creators.

## What's new for Vewrite in 2025

When running projects, one of the most important things is to be able to let those around you know how things are progressing. Within a company, there is usually (hopefully) some structure and cadence that allows stakeholders to get regular updates on what you have done and why. There's a need to justify the job that you're doing, and allow for adjustment as necessary.

Up until now, for a small startup like Vewrite, there has been little need for a consistent product report to be produced. Until there was something built, I just hadn't believe that it was worth talking about it. Now that we are getting close to a closed-beta release, I think that it is time to start.

I do have to admit that I've missed making regular reports because fundamentally there is something to be said for saying, "I've done this, and here is why." This is not just because there's someone above you who demands it, but because the act of speaking has value in itself. It makes things real.

So, as we ramp up towards launching the Vewrite product to the public, I'm going to be talking about the product cycle we are going through, the features that we are building, and of course, the reasoning behind all of it. I do hope that you'll stick around.

### Quick Summary

For those of you who are vaguely interested and just want a quick TLDR summary, the project update is summed up with:

- Many new features have been implemented for the Vewrite product
  - Client management
  - Team management
  - Project management
  - Workflow creation and use
  - Deliverables management
- Vewrite has new branding that fits the target market better
- Vewrite has a more professional, deeper website for its product

The rest of this article is going to be delving deeper into each on of these items. Let's get to it.

## Product Report

### New Features

There is a lot that is being built at the foundational level for [Phase 1](/company/mission), which will be used to support the envisioned expanded set of features that Vewrite will eventually have.

The things that all of the other phases require are predicates for their being built. We will need a way for users to build projects, have deliverables in those projects, have teams of stakeholders and writers, and of course, workflows that will power it all. This has largely been the focus of work for the last three months.

We're really proud to show that the vast majority of it is now up and running. For example, you can now easily create custom workflows, and use them to run your projects.

The writing experience has been reworked and refined, and now allows for a much more integrated experience when using these workflows in your team's writing process.

### New branding

As part of the push to make the product more professional and appealing, we went through a complete branding cycle to replace the temporary branding that we threw together at the start of the project. 

The branding principles that we targeted were:

- Modern and tech-oriented
- Recognizable
- Simple
- That had a standalone mark

In addition, a set palette of colors was developed and implemented across the application and this new website (we'll talk about that in a second). This new palette gives a professional, fresh feel to the entire product.

### New website

In addition to the new branding, we've designed and implemented a new website.

This isn't just a branding shift, but a whole content strategy update with a big focus on explaining the problems that users who create content face, and how Vewrite's product is a solid fit for fixing them.

With a deeper and more in-depth set of pages, we are hoping that we can convince you that our product is the best tool on the market for how to run projects that have many writers, who are working on many deliverables.
